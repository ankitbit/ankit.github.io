I work mostly on the applications (and, sometimes theory) of [machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing](/papers) etc. to innovate for real world problems in the areas of public policy and governance, education, homeland security and criminal justice, intelligence and surveillance, healthcare etc. I also write [data science software](/software), [curate and create data sets](/data), and sometimes give talks about [interesting applications of data science](/talks).

If you want to keep up with everything we are working on, follow me on Twitter [@acmankit](http://twitter.com/acmankit). The best way to contact me is my gmail account (ankitt.nic@gmail.com).
